    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a game which a character named <b>Gandalf</b> should go to destination(<b>Gondor</b>) from the start state. In the way, it may see some characters named <b>Orak</b> with military rank n that they monitor cells with a Manhattan distance of n. Before Gandalf reachs Gondor, it should find <b>assistants</b> and put them in their <b>destinations</b> and also they should take care the oraks restrictions. \n",

    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gray Gandalf confronts Sauron the Dark Lord with the goal of leading and guiding the allies of the mission ring. To do this, he must pass the allies of the ring through the Oraks, which are Sauron's army, and bring each one to a specific position, and at the end he goes to Gondor. Gandalf has checkered patterns that include the following:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "Gandalf started state\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>    \n",
    "Position of each of the ring assistants\n",
    "    </li>        \n",
    "    <li>        \n",
    "Position of orcs\n",
    "    </li>        \n",
    "    <li>        \n",
    "The place where each ring friend should be placed\n",
    "    </li>       \n",
    "    <li>       \n",
    "Final position (Gondor)\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Orak has a military rank of n, according to which it monitors houses with a Manhattan distance of n that Gandalf and his companions cannot pass. Because Gandalf is supposed to pass through the oraks at night and they are asleep, it can pass through the houses they monitor as long as they do not wake them up. After passing n houses in the area under the supervision of the Oraks, they wake up. That is, by moving the 1 + n, we have to go outside the range. After leaving the area under the supervision of the orcs, you can return to that area without considering the previous moves. In each move, Gandalf can move to one of the four houses adjacent to the current house, ie up, down, left and right, provided that the destination house is outside\n",
    "There is no map area and there is no Oraks in it. Gandalf picks up the house where the ring companions are and picks him up, and after reaching the ring's location, he settles him there without spending time. Gandalf can only have one of the ring's companions at a time. The position of the assistants and the place where they should be located are never within the control of the Oraks and the two areas under the supervision of the Oraks are not shared."

    "In BFS we search for near cells and for each state, first cell has been appended in frontier poped and check its children to find the goal and if it doesn't find the goal, the children will be appended in frontier to check in next steps.<br/>\n",
    "In IDS, we define a length to check that for each time, how many depth we can go and do DFS for every length we go to find the goal state. If the goal state doesn't be found, increase length and do DFS again for new length.<br/>\n",
    "In A*, we define a heuristic_pars that is a variable to save f, g and h. h is the least distance to goal state, g is the path cost that have traveled and f is equal to g plus h. we use them to find the best way to go to the goal state. When we go to wach cell and then check their children, we don't check children's state with goal state; we just do that with the the current cell that is poped from openlist.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented heuristic is the the sum of two cells' x distance with  two cells' y distance. It is consistent because for each cell we approach, we are getting closer to the goal state so the f value along a path increases or equals to previous cell and this is a proof that this heuristic is consistent.<br/>\n",

    "BFS, IDS and A* find the best path cost for question and their answer are optimal(as seen in test cases' results) but they are different in seen states count; because although these algorithms are used to find optimal path, but their surface are different in states that go.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that IDS see too many states to find the optimal way and in result, it takes more time than other algorithms. In weighted A*, this algorithm prefer to reach goal by see less states and spend less time but the path may not be optimal.<br/>\n",
    "In <b>time spending</b>, we can usually have this comparation:    A* &le; BFS &le; IDS"
